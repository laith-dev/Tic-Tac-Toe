Usage:
> start playerX playerO

Substitute playerX/playerO with any of these options:
- user: a human player that will be asked about the index about his next move.
- easy/medium/hard: an AI computer player with different levels of difficulty that knows how to play the game.

For example:
> start user hard

This command will assign the human player (user) as the X player and the hard AI player (hard) as the O player.

- To make the computer play against itself, just the choose the difficulty for both players, for example:
> start medium hard
> start hard hard
...etc.
